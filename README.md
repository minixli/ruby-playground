# ðŸ”´ ruby-playground

A collection of Ruby rewrites, mostly based on **EventMachine** and inspired by the Pomelo framework for real-time, scalable server architecture.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

- [**citrus**](./citrus)  
  Core framework inspired by [Pomelo](https://github.com/NetEase/pomelo) 

- [**citrus-rpc**](./citrus-rpc)  
  RPC layer inspired by [pomelo-rpc](https://github.com/NetEase/pomelo-rpc).

- [**citrus-monitor**](./citrus-monitor)  
  A monitoring and metrics module inspired by [pomelo-monitor](https://github.com/NetEase/pomelo-monitor).

- [**citrus-admin**](./citrus-admin)  
  Admin and management interface inspired by [pomelo-admin](https://github.com/NetEase/pomelo-admin).

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

These projects serve as both **historical record** of my learning path and as **references** for event-driven server programming in Ruby.

**Note:** These projects are mainly for **experiments and learning purposes**. They do not fully replicate all features of the original Pomelo components and are **not yet complete**.
